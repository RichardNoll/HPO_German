---
- This German version of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
is in obo format.
- There are still some duplications among the synonyms that have been created by the automated translation with DeepL. However, the duplicates are automatically removed during the search using the script below.

Program Usage Instructions
Start the Program: Run the Python script.

1. Choose Search Type:

When prompted, you will be asked to choose the type of search you want to perform. You have two options:
Type code if you want to search by specific HPO codes.
Type name if you want to search for a specific term by its name or synonym.

2. Enter Your Search Term:

If you chose code, enter the HPO codes separated by commas (e.g., HP:0000013, HP:0000023). Each code must follow the format HP: followed by a seven-digit number.
If you chose name, enter the term or synonym you are looking for. The search is case-insensitive.

3. Include Definitions (Only for Code Search):

If you chose to search by code, you will be asked if you want to include definitions in your search results. Type yes or no.

4. View Results:

The results will be displayed in the console.
For a code search, you'll see the name, synonyms, and optionally definitions associated with each code.
For a name search, the program will display the corresponding HPO code.

5. Error Messages:

If an invalid code is entered in the code search, an error message will indicate this and prompt the correct format.
If no information is found for a particular code or term, the program will inform you of this.

Remember, this program is designed to work with a specific document structure used for HPO codes, names, synonyms, and definitions. Ensure that the "hp full de.txt" file is in the correct format and located in the same directory as your script for the program to function correctly.
