This German version of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is in obo format. There are still some duplications among the synonyms that have been created by the automated translation with DeepL. However, the duplicates are automatically removed during the search using the script below.

Individual codes or a list of codes can be entered in the "SATURN_HPO_GERMAN_PIPELINE.py" module via an input prompt and the outputs are the German names, definitions and synonyms. Simply start the module in Python, enter the code list, select definitions and read the output.


This is explicitly not an official translation of the HPO. The translation is for research purposes and the further development of the HPO in various languages. 


The English HPO is freely available at https://hpo.jax.org/app/
